# CookbookExample: AI-Powered Adaptive Language Toggle

## Overview
This project implements an **AI-powered Adaptive Language Toggle** system that enhances user experience by dynamically adapting the application's language preferences based on user behavior and system settings.

## Features
1. **System Language Detection**:
   - Automatically detects the system's default language.
   - Adapts the application's language accordingly using AI.

2. **Browser Language Detection**:
   - Sets the default language based on browser settings for a seamless user experience.

3. **Learning User Preferences**:
   - Implements an NLP-based learning model to analyze and learn user language preferences over time.
   - Stores preferences to provide a more personalized experience.

4. **Dynamic Translation**:
   - If the user selects a language different from the system language, the system:
     - Uses the browser's built-in translation feature initially.
     - Employs the Google Translation API or the NLP model to continue providing translations.

5. **Language Switching Suggestions**:
   - Automatically suggests setting a frequently switched-to language as the default for easier access.

6. **Workflow Consistency**:
   - Ensures smooth transitions between languages without disrupting the user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: For language detection and implementing the learning model.
- **Local Storage**: To store user language preferences and ensure persistent behavior.
- **Google Translation API**: (Optional) For advanced language translation capabilities.
- **NLP Model**: For learning user behavior and adapting to preferences over time.
